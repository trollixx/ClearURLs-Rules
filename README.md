# ClearURLs Rules

[ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs) is a browser extension, which removes tracking and other junk from the links.

This repo contains extended set of rules for the extension, so I can update them more frequently than upstream.

## Usage

Use the following URLs in the extension settings.

URL of the `data.json` file:

```text
https://trollixx.github.io/clearurls-rules/rules.min.json
```

URL of the `rules.hash` file:

```text
https://trollixx.github.io/clearurls-rules/rules.min.json.hash
```
